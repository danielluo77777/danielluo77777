 Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel!
 I am a sophomore student @ UW seattle, majoring in Maths. I am very excited about machine learning and AI. 
 I grew up in Guangzhou, China, top 3 city in China. Undoubtly, we also have the best food in China haha. I came to USA after high school.
 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently working as a end2end machine learning engineer intern in the data center team @ infinitus(China).
- ðŸ“« I am best reached in email(daniel66@uw.edu) cuz I check email each and every day.
- Fun fact: I am an almost-pro player in clash of clans(definitely reach out if you are interested in competitive COC!)
- More fun facts: I have been doing workouts for almost two years, basketball for 5 years and soccer for 7 years.
